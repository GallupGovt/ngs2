# Abstract

<mark>To be written last, based on final results.</mark>

# Pre-registration summary

+ The experiment was pre-registered on 2017-04-04, and the pre-registration form is available at https://osf.io/6jvw9/.
+ The experiment was later amended on 2017-07-07 per https://osf.io/ngwqa/.
+ And amended again on 2017-08-08 per https://osf.io/qymzh/.

## Experimental design:

+ Each player resides on a nonweighted network, with 20% possible links formed at *random*.
+ His/her *neighbors* are players connected to him/her on this network.
+ Each player exercises one of the following two actions during each round of the game.
    - Cooperation: paying 50 units for each neighbor and results in 100 units gain for each neighbor. 
    - Defection: paying nothing and generating no benefits.
+ Before each round, players are reminded of their number of neighbors and these neighbors' prior decisions. 
+ After each round, players learn about the decisions of their neighbors and their own payoff.
+ The probability for each subsequent round is 0.8, which was communicated to players. 

## Experimental conditions:

At the beginning of the experiment, the social network isinitialized with 20% of possible links being formed at random. We examine three kinds of network conditions: random link updating, fixed links, and strategic link updating.

+ **Fixed** links: the network is static for the duration of the experiment
+ **Random** link updating: the social network is regenerated randomly after every round
+ Strategic link updating: a rewiring step following each round. Subject pairs are randomly selected and one randomly selected actor of the selected pair will be given the option to change the status between the pair (connected to disconnected, or disconnected to connected.) The deciding actor will be provided with behavior of the alter's during the previous round. At the end of the rewiring step, each player will receive summaries about updates involved him/her. 
    - **Viscous**: 10% randomly picked subject pairs selected to have an option of change.
    - **Fluid**: 30% randomly picked subject pairs selected to have an option of change.

## Hypotheses, variables and expected effect sizes

```{r hypotheses, echo=FALSE}
hypexp1 <- read.csv("hyp_exp1.csv")
library(knitr)
kable(hypexp1, 
          caption = "Experimental Hypotheses, Variables, and Expected Effect Sizes")
```

## Data used for the prediction

+ Gallup recruited a total of `r length(unique(exp1_cooperation$pid))` unique players for the experiment. 
+ Gallup ran a total of `r length(unique(exp1_cooperation$session))` instances of the experiment. 
+ Research participants were recruited from  <mark>(Update sample size by country)</mark>
    - The Gallup Panel in the U.S. (n=500) 
    - In-person recruitment efforts in Morocco (n=250) 
    - In-person recruitment efforts in the Philippines (n=250) 

The study hypotheses are tested using two datasets, a "cooperation" dataset showing cooperation decisions at the individual level for each cooperation round, and "rewire" dataset showing connection decisions at the individual level for each rewiring round. 

### Cooperation data

The "cooperation" dataset includes the following variables:

```{r cooperation descriptives}
names(exp1_cooperation)
datatable(sample_n(exp1_cooperation, 5), 
          caption = "Randomly selected rows of cooperation data.",
          options = list(
              scrollX = TRUE,
              scrollCollapse = TRUE))
```

### Rewire data

The "rewire" dataset includes the following variables:

```{r rewire decriptives}
names(exp1_rewire)
datatable(sample_n(exp1_rewire, 5), 
          caption = "Randomly selected rows of rewire data.",
          options = list(
              scrollX = TRUE,
              scrollCollapse = TRUE))
```
