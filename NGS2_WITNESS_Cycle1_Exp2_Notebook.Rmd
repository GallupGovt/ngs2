# Pre-registration summary

+ The experiment was pre-registered on 2017-03-31, and the pre-registration form is available at https://osf.io/swpa6/.
+ The experiment was later amended on 2017-07-07 per https://osf.io/qjhb5/.
+ And amended again on 2017-08-08 per https://osf.io/qzgk2/.

## Experimental design:

+ Subjects are given the option to affiliate with one of several available groups represented by evaluatively neutral avatars, such as geometric patterns or pictures of animals.

+ Subjects are then be given the opportunity to form network connections with both in-group and out-group members. Connections will be established based on mutual agreement (i.e. accepting connection requests). 

+ Once networks are formed, subjects play a multi-round cooperation game where they are given the option to cooperate with their neighbors or defect.

-	Cooperate entails reducing one's own wealth by 50 'units' per neighbor in order to increase the wealth of all neighbors by 100 units each while defection generates no unit cost or benefit.
-	Before making each decision, subjects are reminded of their number of neighbors and the neighbors' previous decisions.
-	At the end of each turn, subjects are informed about the decisions of their neighbors, along with their own payoff.

+ After every round, the probability that another round will occur is 0.8, and the probability that there will be a rewiring round is 0.25. At each rewiring round subjects are reminded of the size and the performance of each group and are given the opportunity to choose to switch to a different group or stay with their current group. If subjects switch groups, new within and between group ties will have to be generated de novo according to the procedure outlined above.


## Experimental conditions:

 Subjects are randomly assigned to one of four conditions of varying diversity of group identities (two avatar options vs four avatar options) and group-pairing probabilities (Unbiased random pairings in which subjects are equally likely to be paired with in-group vs out-group members vs. biased pairings in which subjects are more likely to be paired with in-group members). These two factors are combined in a factorial design, with the resulting four conditions: 

+	Unbiased Pairing - 2 Avatars
+	Unbiased Pairing - 4 Avatars
+	Biased Pairing - 2 Avatars
+	Biased Pairing - 4 Avatars

## Hypotheses, variables and expected effect sizes

```{r hypotheses, echo=FALSE}
hypexp2 <- read.csv("hyp_exp2.csv")
library(knitr)
kable(hypexp2, 
          caption = "Experimental Hypotheses, Variables, and Expected Effect Sizes")
```

## Data used for the prediction

+ Gallup recruited a total of `r length(unique(exp2_cooperation$pid))` unique players for the experiment. 
+ Gallup ran a total of `r length(unique(exp2_cooperation$session))` instances of the experiment. 
+ Research participants were recruited from  <mark>(Update sample size by country)</mark>
    - The Gallup Panel in the U.S. (n=500) 
    - In-person recruitment efforts in Morocco (n=250) 
    - In-person recruitment efforts in the Philippines (n=250) 

The study hypotheses are tested using two datasets, a "cooperation" dataset showing cooperation decisions at the individual level for each cooperation round, and "rewire" dataset showing connection decisions at the individual level for each rewiring round. 

### Cooperation data

The "cooperation" dataset includes the following variables:

```{r cooperation descriptives}
names(exp2_cooperation)
datatable(sample_n(exp2_cooperation, 10), 
          caption = "Randomly selected rows of cooperation data.",
          options = list(
              scrollX = TRUE,
              scrollCollapse = TRUE))
```

### Rewire data

The "rewire" dataset includes the following variables:

```{r rewire decriptives}
names(exp2_rewire)
datatable(sample_n(exp2_rewire, 10), 
          caption = "Randomly selected rows of rewire data.",
          options = list(
              scrollX = TRUE,
              scrollCollapse = TRUE))
```
