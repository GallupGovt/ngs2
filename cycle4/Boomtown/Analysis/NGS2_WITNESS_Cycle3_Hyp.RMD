# Machine Learning

Since the aim of the NGS2 program is being able to quickly and reliably single models that can predict and explain group innovation, we conduct a model robustness check by comparing the model-based predictions of a full Bayesian GLMM with the data-driven predictions of a machine learning (ML) approach. ML algorithms can efficiently discover complex dependencies in the data, including non-linear relationships and multiple-order interactions between predictors, which will lead to biased estimates of predictor coefficients and lower overall model fit if left ignored. 

We train a Random Forests model using the caret package in R (R Core Team, 2018), using a random subset of the experimental data including 80% of the cases (stratified by game) to train the model with 5-fold cross-validation, with the remaining 20% of cases put aside in a testing dataset. Out of sample performance of both the ML and Bayesian models will be assessed through a comparison of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, as estimated from the testing dataset.
